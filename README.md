# AMFile_rename

* after compiling the source to an exe , copy the exe file into the files located floder , which need to rename .

* for now if you want to use a data file which store the addressse and names , you'd better rename the file to "download.txt" and put it into the same location , run the exe , chose "1" , and the rename_progress would start
* if you want to input the data , don't forget to input the addition last line with "E O F"
 

## the data should input in con or import from file must obey the format
```file.ext file.name.mp3
   file1.ext file.name1.mp4
   file2.ext file.name2.avi
   E O F
```

## this is my first open source program , with my learning progress going on , would I upload more source
